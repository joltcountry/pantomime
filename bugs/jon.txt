“Little,” says Chmod. “I’ve been here every night for the last two weeks, ever since
I cashed out my Roth IRA.”

“Whoa!” you say. “Hey, congratulations. I thought you were going to use that money
to get off this moon, though? Why would you want to hang around the 
sphincter of the solar system for a second longer than you had to?”

“Well, have you seen the new girls they’ve got working here? It changed everything.
I can’t leave. Not yet. It’s very frustrating.”

“Because you’re a robot and they are cloned pantomimes of long-dead Earth girls, and
how will they ever understand you, coming from such radically different 
worlds?”

“No. Because I haven’t got a penis.” Always an uncomfortable topic when broached,
you stare at the ground for a few moments. It still looks like gray sand. 
“Besides,” adds Chmod, “this place only allows real girls.”

The doorman arrives from the north.

“People, and machines, navigate Mars and its two moons through the use of keycards,”
says Chmod. “Why don’t you check to see if you have one for this 
club?”

Chmod sighs. It comes out all fuzzy. “He is the person who can let you into the
club. That is his job. Give him your keycard. He keeps the riff-raff out.”

And it’s true. When man colonized the Moon he sent his best engineers, technicians,
pioneers and survivors. When he imprinted upon Mars, Titan and 
Ganymede he did the same. By the time the life bubble was ready on Phobos mankind
was really just looking for a place to dump its extra and unwanted 
pantomimes. An entire world filled to the brim with poor copies of undesirables that
nobody particularly cared for the first time around.

With that much human garbage around there was a growing need for people to keep them
out of places. This has worked reasonably well. You can’t quite 
leave a fresh-baked apple pie out on your ledge, but you can put the trash out and
expect to get your cans back.

[We won’t bother with the ‘What Next?’ bit any longer.]

>x doorman
Not everyone gladhandled their way onto Phobos due to their charm and good looks
like you did, Raif. Some denizens look like they were either spontaneously 
generated from some of the wetter craters, or else pantomimed from some of the
bulgier parts of Sir John Merrick. The doorman might not have a ticket on a 
solar flight back to Earth, but maybe if he hangs on tight he can surf a rock down
to the surface — it’s only 4600 meters. He’d have experienced farther 
average distances from most females if he didn’t work at Kangaroo’s.

>i
You are carrying a red keycard.

>x red
It’s a cheap piece of red plastic with a transmitter or signal attractor inside.
It’s the size of an index card, albeit a little thicker.

>show card to doorman

“Okay,” he says, “You can go in.” He lets Chmod past as well.

“Hey!” cries out some nobody a few places back in line, “How come the robot gets to
go in? He ain’t got a card!”

“Shut up,” suggests the doorman. “You could all shut up...  The robot spent more
here last night than any of you have in the last month.” That seems to satisfy 
the crowd for the most part, at least those who care about a walking shop vac
getting some place before them.

Chmod bristles for a second. “That’s embarrassing, man... don’t tell them that.”

The doorman looks ready to affix a ‘Lap Dance King’ sticker to Chmod.

>in
You can’t go that way.

Purchasing Kiosk
There is no real difference in light level between the surface of Phobos and this
tight little payment chamber except that it’s more blue in here. To your left is a 
wizened old soul behind a bulletproof window. You can buy a ‘membership’ for the
night from him, but it’s really just a cover charge. A pair of closed, dark blue 
curtains lurk north, shielding you from the debauchary beyond, in case you created
some interference to your moral compass by getting this far without 
realizing it. You can hear some muffled music in that direction and it smells like
ham in here.

Mr Chmod is here.

>buy membership
The old guy looks at his monitor and it pisses him off for some reason. “You got no
money on you! No money, no membership, dat’s how it works, duh!” You 
bristle a bit at an actual adult saying ‘Duh’ to you. It’s clear that he’s behind a
bulletproof window for a reason.

[1] “My wallet! Chmod, I’ve lost my wallet!”
[2] “I don’t frequent strip joints. What am I supposed to do, Chmod?”

“Oh, yeah... sorry, I’m a little distracted. You left it at my apartment last
night.” Mr. Chmod opens up a small compartment and hands you your wallet. “Just 
show this to the old guy and we can get inside.”

>talk to chmod
You can’t think of anything to say right now.

>show wallet to guy
The old soul doesn’t seem too interested in the wallet.

>buy membership
You wave your wallet around the room. You feel like a complete prick, as your old
credit card had a magnetic strip on it and you never had to make a spectacle 
out of yourself. It seems to work, though.

“Ahh, membership paid for, you rich prick! You go in!” The old guy behind the
counter shakes his head at your arrogance, happy that you’re not snapping your 
fingers for further attention.

Kangaroo’s Midnight Gentleman’s Club
Bars on all sides surround a central stage where a slick, rectangular dancing
platform sits. Most adult clubs have either a Marilyn Monroe or Audrey Hepburn 
clone working for them because people born in the 20th century don’t have their DNA
under an ironclad copyright. However, the owner of this club prides 
himself on having no pantomimes dancing. The DJ’s patter is a painful hipster and
the girls hardly ever lip synch the words of the songs.

Scarlett waves for you and Chmod to walk over and sit down next to her.

Mr Chmod is here.

There is a lone stool available for you to sit on. Luckily, it’s next to Scarlett.

>sit on stool
You get onto the uncomfortable stool.

Kangaroo’s Midnight Gentleman’s Club, on the uncomfortable stool
It’s like any other strip club in the future and past: bars on all sides surround a
central stage where a slick, rectangular dancing platform sits. Twin bubbly and 
transparent poles on either edge of the platform rise vanish into a thick, foggy
ceiling, and fairly frequently a beautiful woman wraps herself around one of 
them. There are tables scattered all around, with their own metallic poles
stretching up into the nothingness.

Scarlett is sitting down in a chair near the stage.

Mr Chmod is here.

A gorgeous redhead gracefully struts up to the center stage wearing only stiletto
heels and a microphone on a ring. She clears her voice and gives the crowd a 
confident smile. She’s one of the best-looking women ever to leave Earth and has no
problem commanding the attention of the room.

>x scarlett
Scarlett is wearing a white, long-sleeved blouse, a billowy gypsy’s skirt and a
zebra-print headband. 

The redhead self-conciously coughs once into her microphone. “I’m Cinnamon,” she
purrs. The crowd applauds and hoots. She smiles with such warmth that 
Mimas evaporates. “I’d like to thank you all for coming tonight. We have a very
special guest at the club tonight... you know him as the Governor of New York 
and for the campaign he’s running to be President of the United States of America...
Ladies and Gentlemen — “ she laughs and brings the mic away from her 
face for a moment. This woman has a three-picture deal back on Earth and was leaving
the moon soon anyway. “I present William Howard Taft!”

There is applause everywhere, managing to drown out the horrible music that the DJ
has faithfully not stopped playing. It’s all very enthusiastic, save for the 
very, very back of the club near the curtains.

>talk to scarlett

[1] “Hi, there!”
[2] “Thank you for saving us seats!”

“WHAT? SAY AGAIN?” says Scarlett. The background music seems to squeeze all other
audio right out of the room.

Taft walks briskly up to the stage, all business. Cinnamon slowly peels off the
microphone from her ring finger and passes it to Taft, bending down slightly to 
give him a kiss on the cheek. Taft takes the opportunity to squeeze a breast, to the
banal, delighted fury of the crowd. You see Scarlett wipe her brow; it’s 
really starting to get warm in here. Taft laughs in that sort of chortle that big
guys make and puts the mic on.

“Thank you all for being here tonight. Thank you all...” Taft wrinkles his nose for
a second as he notices the commotion going on at the back of the club.

>x commotion
You strain your neck, slightly concerned, but figure that security will handle it.
They wouldn’t let you in here without proper ID and is there anything rarer on 
Phobos than a red keycard? Besides, you usually get yelled at if your eyes aren’t
directly focused on the stage in these kind of places. It’s Pavlovian.

Taft begins his speech even though it’s clear he’d like the room to be free of
distractions. Even though it concerns a moon nobody on Earth cares about, the 
fate of Phobos is still pretty critical to everyone on it. After a few honeyed words
to begin his opening, however, he finds the ruckus towards the back 
intolerable.

“Excuse me,” he says, away from the microphone and to one of the club’s nearby
bouncers. It appears as if Taft wants them to do something about the 
shouting coming from the back of the club. You turn to say something snotty about
Taft to Scarlett when you hear two pops — two sharp shots about two 
seconds apart. You see Taft collapse to the floor. Things quickly turn to bedlam
inside the club.

>clap
You don’t need to use the word “clap”.

>get up
If you leave your stool there’s a good chance that somebody would figuratively or
literally steal it.

>talk to scarlett
Scarlett isn’t able to speak to anyone right now.

Chmod, facing a different direction than you, suddenly gasps. “Oh... oh, no...” 

He presses one of his cold robotic hands against your shoulder and turns you around.
You see Scarlett sitting upright, so comfortably in her chair... her dead 
eyes looking straight ahead, head slumped to the side, her white blouse quickly
turning a deep crimson.



Long ago, far away


Night life on Phobos consisted of throwing rocks at pantomimes of long-dead
politicians and celebrities who were unpopular in their original lives.

It was long before you had ever heard of Taft or shrinking orbits or localized
planetary rings. It was a Saturday. You and Scarlett heard screams a few hundred 
meters before you even got to the gate. The crowd was really giving the new guy a
workout. It was theraputic for the populace — nobody who made it to 
Phobos wanted to stay there for more a few days, but shuttles only ran once every
two (Earth) months. The time died slow and hard, and punching a Mugabe 
kept everyone sane.

There were a few rules hastily scrawled onto a tablet that you had to read before
you could fork over the admission fee. You could not ask direct questions to 
the entertainment. You could not feed the entertainment. You had to stay ten meters
away from the entertainment and could only throw rocks, as tomatoes 
were a premium on Phobos.  Mugabe wouldn’t shut up and stop bleating so you could
read the rest of the rules in peace. 

Mugabe kept proclaiming that he had no idea why he was chained up, why he was there,
why he was being tortured, who he was... You asked the clerk about 
it and he just gave a bored shrug and said that they get that a lot. Everyone is
innocent. Nobody harmed a soul in their original lifetime - just ask them. A 
mime’s memories were intact from the day they died and there was usually a lot of
begging for forgiveness and apologizing. That wasn’t the case with the new 
guy. This one’s head was empty. (Technically, his head was a bruised and lumpy mess
due to all the pulverized moon rock that was thrown at it, but his mind 
was a blank, anyway.) 

Your face screwed up as you entered into a deep thought. You turned to face
Scarlett. “There’s something we haven’t completely thought out here,” you said. 
“Something isn’t quite right about how we’re going to do this. Something nobody
considered...” Scarlett’s head cocked to the side as to just what was the 
matter.

“What is it, love?” she said.

“Where on Phobos are we going to find any rocks?”
