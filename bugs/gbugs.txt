In the response to "x chmod" - are Melvin and Mendenhall the same
person? Should the first reference give the whole name?

After the shooting, if you look, Scarlett is still sitting next to
you. Actually, maybe that's not a bug, since you don't realize at
first that she's been shot...

"who is joe" in office - Chmod isn't there, but you still get the
"Chmod doesn't know" message

The couch is described initially as a "sofa", but "sofa" isn't implemented

"Projector" isn't implemented

Joe Carter isn't mentioned in the room description (only when you x the couch)

and, obviously, I'm stuck on how to get the message from the phone.
I'm off -- will do more later. If you get this, can you let me know
the command to get the message?

What next? >x chmod
Artificial intelligence reached a breakthrough years ago when a computer science grad student and extreme programmer named Melvin tried to get his robot to drive in downtown Denver during rush 
hour. Mendenhall learned that his construct was wholly able to blend in from exit 195 to 240 even though his code had several logic errors in the driving routines. The robot noticed as many unblinking 
turn signals, acts of tailgating and poor decision making during lane merges from the other drivers — as well as producing as many extended middle fingers — as Mendenhall’s own driving did. 
Because you write the tests before the code in extreme programming Mendenhall pronounced his work as complete and graduated. 

The next day Mendenhall’s robot left at half past three and initiated the obligatory evening-commute-turned-parking-lot by crashing into an abandoned Passat in the breakdown lane. Mendenhall 
pronounced it as the proudest day of his life. 

Mr Chmod is a sentient shop vac and likewise, extreme programmed. He is two meters in height with long, floppy arms and a variety of attachments on the back. He has tank tread at the bottom of 
his slender base that provide locomotion and a small cynlinder at head level that contains most of his brain procedures and a Toronto Blue Jays cap you gave him. He is gray and red and has a 
‘TYPE R’ sticker that was unknowingly placed on his back by you.

“Little,” says Chmod. “I’ve been here every night for the last two weeks, ever since I cashed out my Roth IRA.”

“Whoa!” you say. “Hey, congratulations. I thought you were going to use that money to get off this moon, though? Why would you want to hang around the sphincter of the solar system for a second 
longer than you had to?”

“Well, have you seen the new girls they’ve got working here? It changed everything. I can’t leave. Not yet. It’s very frustrating.”

“Because you’re a robot and they are cloned pantomimes of long-dead Earth girls, and how will they ever understand you, coming from such radically different worlds?”

“No. Because I haven’t got a penis.” Always an uncomfortable topic when broached, you stare at the ground for a few moments. It still looks like gray sand. “Besides,” adds Chmod, “this place only 
allows real girls.”

The doorman arrives from the north.

“You need a keycard to get in tonight,” says the doorman. “Because of the high security.” An older French guy appears from the club and touches the doorman on the shoulder. 

“Excusez-moi, I need to get more scrip out of my cycle.”

The doorman gives him permission with a brief wave. “Just go right in when you get back,” he says. He turns his attention to you. “Anyway, show me a keycard and you’re all set. Until then, I’ll have to 
ask you to not get aggressive.”

>show keycard to doorman

“Okay,” he says, “You can go in.” He lets Chmod past as well.

“Hey!” cries out some nobody a few places back in line, “How come the robot gets to go in? He ain’t got a card!”

“Shut up,” suggests the doorman. “You could all shut up...  The robot spent more here last night than any of you have in the last month.” That seems to satisfy the crowd for the most part, at least 
those who care about a walking shop vac getting some place before them.

Chmod bristles for a second. “That’s embarrassing, man... don’t tell them that.”

The doorman looks ready to affix a ‘Lap Dance King’ sticker to Chmod.

Purchasing Kiosk
There is no real difference in light level between the surface of Phobos and this tight little payment chamber except that it’s more blue. To your left is a wizened old soul behind a bulletproof window. 
You can buy a ‘membership’ for the night from him, but it’s really just a cover charge. A pair of closed, deep cyan curtains lurk east, shielding you from the debauchary beyond (in case you created 
some interference to your moral compass by getting this far without realizing it). You can hear some muffled music in that direction and it just generally smells like ham in here.

“Just give the old man some scrip. Or wave your wallet around the room.”

“Isn’t that sort of obnoxious?”

“Only to poor people. And I don’t see any here.”

“What about,” you bring your voice down to a murmur, “What about the old guy here?”

“No,” says Chmod, at normal volume, “I literally can’t see poor people. Ha ha, why waste the cycles, right?”

You can’t think of anything to say right now.

You can’t go that way until you buy a membership for the night.

The old guy looks at his monitor and it pisses him off for some reason. “You got no money on you! No money, no membership, dat’s how it works, duh!” You bristle a bit at an actual adult saying 
‘Duh’ to you. It’s clear that he’s behind a bulletproof window for a reason.

Kangaroo’s Midnight Gentleman’s Club
Bars on all sides surround a central stage where a slick, rectangular dancing platform sits. Most adult clubs have either a Marilyn Monroe or Audrey Hepburn clone working for them because people 
born in the 20th century don’t have their DNA under an ironclad copyright. However, the owner of this club prides himself on having no pantomimes dancing. The DJ’s patter is a painful hipster and 
the girls hardly ever lip synch the words of the songs. The graceful arc anf beauty of women are the chief form of entertainment on Phobos — it would have been jugglers, save for the fact that the 
weak gravity generators installed below made everyone a three-chainsaw and Tabby expert.

Scarlett waves for you and Chmod to walk over and sit down next to her.

There is a lone stool available for you to sit on. Luckily, it’s next to Scarlett.

>sit on stool
You get onto the uncomfortable stool.

Kangaroo’s Midnight Gentleman’s Club, on the uncomfortable stool
It’s like any other strip club in the future and past: bars on all sides surround a central stage where a slick, rectangular dancing platform sits. Twin bubbly and transparent poles on either edge of the 
platform rise vanish into a thick, foggy ceiling, and fairly frequently a beautiful woman wraps herself around one of them. There are tables scattered all around, with their own metallic poles stretching 
up into the nothingness.

Scarlett is sitting down next to you near the stage.

A gorgeous redhead gracefully struts up to the center stage wearing only stiletto heels and a microphone on a ring. She clears her voice and gives the crowd a confident smile. She’s one of the best-
looking women ever to leave Earth and has no problem commanding the attention of the room.

>x scarlett
Scarlett is a pantomime of a girl you dated several years ago. She’s wearing an ivory-colored, long-sleeved blouse, a billowy gypsy’s skirt and a zebra-print headband.

The redhead self-consciously coughs once into her microphone. “I’m Cinnamon,” she purrs. The crowd applauds and hoots. She smiles with such warmth that Mimas evaporates. “I’d like to thank 
you all for coming tonight. We have a very special guest at the club tonight... you know him as the Governor of New York and for the campaign he’s running to be President of the United States of 
America... Ladies and Gentlemen — “ she laughs and brings the mic away from her face for a moment. This woman has a three-picture deal back on Earth and was leaving the moon soon anyway. 
“I present William Howard Taft!”

There is applause everywhere, managing to drown out the horrible music that the DJ has faithfully not stopped playing. It’s all very enthusiastic, save for the very, very back of the club near the 
curtains.

>x curtains
They’re thick and inviting and would make terrific bed covers. Cloth of this quality is tough to get on Phobos.

Taft walks briskly up to the stage, all business. Cinnamon slowly peels off the microphone from her ring finger and passes it to Taft, bending down slightly to give him a kiss on the cheek. Taft takes 
the opportunity to squeeze a breast, to the banal, delighted fury of the crowd. You see Scarlett wipe her brow; it’s really starting to get warm in here. Taft laughs in that sort of chortle that big guys 
make and puts the mic on.

“Thank you all for being here tonight. Thank you all...” Taft wrinkles his nose for a second as he notices the commotion going on at the back of the club.

>x taft
Taft today is not as large as he was when he was President of the United States of America, but he’s still pretty roomy. He has Criscoed brown hair, a handlebar moustache that hasn’t been in style 
in almost 200 years and locomotes with a waddling gait.

Taft begins his speech though it’s clear he’d like the room to be free of distractions. While his speech concerns a moon that nobody on Earth cares about, the fate of Phobos is still pretty critical to 
everyone on it. After a few honeyed words to begin his opening, however, he finds the ruckus towards the back intolerable.

“Excuse me,” he says, away from the microphone and to one of the club’s nearby bouncers. It appears as if Taft wants them to do something about the shouting coming from the back of the club. 
You turn to say something snotty about Taft to Scarlett when you hear two pops — two sharp shots about two seconds apart. You see Taft collapse to the floor. Things quickly turn to bedlam inside 
the club.

>t scarlett
Scarlett isn’t able to speak to anyone right now.

>x scarlett
Scarlett is a pantomime of a girl you dated several years ago. She’s wearing an ivory-colored, long-sleeved blouse, a billowy gypsy’s skirt and a zebra-print headband.

She is dead.

Chmod, facing a different direction than you, suddenly gasps. “Oh... oh, no...” 

He presses one of his cold robotic hands against your shoulder and turns you around. You see Scarlett sitting upright, so comfortably in her chair... her dead eyes looking straight ahead, head 
slumped to the side, her white blouse quickly turning a deep crimson.



Long ago, far away


Night life on Phobos consisted of throwing rocks at pantomimes of long-dead politicians and celebrities who were unpopular in their original lives.

It was long before you had ever heard of Taft or shrinking orbits or localized planetary rings. It was a Saturday. You and Scarlett heard screams a few hundred meters before you even got to the gate. 
The crowd was really giving the new guy a workout. It was theraputic for the populace — nobody who made it to Phobos wanted to stay there for more a few days, but shuttles only ran once every 
two (Earth) months. The time died slow and hard, and punching a Mugabe kept everyone sane.

There were a few rules hastily scrawled onto a tablet that you had to read before you could fork over the admission fee. You could not ask direct questions to the entertainment. You could not feed the 
entertainment. You had to stay ten meters away from the entertainment and could only throw rocks, as tomatoes were a premium on Phobos.  Mugabe wouldn’t shut up and stop bleating so you 
could read the rest of the rules in peace. 

Mugabe kept proclaiming that he had no idea why he was chained up, why he was there, why he was being tortured, who he was... You asked the clerk about it and he just gave a bored shrug and 
said that they get that a lot. Everyone is innocent. Nobody harmed a soul in their original lifetime - just ask them. A mime’s memories were intact from the day they died and there was usually a lot of 
begging for forgiveness and apologizing. That wasn’t the case with the new guy. This one’s head was empty. (Technically, his head was a bruised and lumpy mess due to all the pulverized moon 
rock that was thrown at it, but his mind was a blank, anyway.) 

You screwed up your face as you entered into thought. You turned to face Scarlett. “There is something we haven’t completely considered,” you said. “Something isn’t quite right about how we’re 
going to do this, something nobody thought of...”

Scarlett cocked her head slightly, inquisitively.

“What is it, honey?” she said.

“Where on Phobos are we going to find any rocks?”

Your Office
It was seven (Earth) days ago that you witnessed the two murders. The shots caused half of the people in the club to panic and evacuate. Chmod felt that someone still had to deliver the news that 
Taft traveled to say, at which point the other half of the club ran screaming. 

You were given priority to leave Phobos because of your girlfriend’s death. But after taking care of some business on Earth you returned — you felt that someone should find out why two people were 
killed, even if they were both just a couple of mimes.

Your office is on the 6th floor of the tallest building on Phobos. From the roof of this building you can see the bubble and in saner days it was guarded.

This room is dominated by a massive carved rock desk. A sofa is off to the side, next to your mini-fridge and chess table. On the ceiling is your projector.

>x me
You are very average and plain looking, with dark hair and almond eyes. You’re in your early thirties but look fairly younger than that, thanks to absorbing far less solar radiation than the average 
Earthbound denizen recently. You were born and raised in a city called Syracuse, which gets only slightly colder than an average night on Phobos outside the bubble.

Your name is Raif.

>x desk
Rudimentary construction sprang forth from the natural resources on Phobos, though it all seems rather samey due to the fact that there’s really just ice and rock around. Joe once said that the desk 
resembled something in the style of Francis Jourdain, but he could hardly tell you the difference between France and Jordan or Ron Francis and Michael Jordan in his usual mental state.

The desk has your phone on it.

>who is joe
Mr Chmod doesn’t seem to know anything about Joe.

>x chmod
You don’t see him.

>x sofa
You don’t need to use the word “sofa”.

>open desk

>open fridge
The food you consumed on Earth has turned you off to even the thought of Phobian delights forever. Everything here just tastes... dusty. It repulses you.

>x projector
You don’t need to use the word “projector”.

>x table
Your father gave you this set when you were thirteen.  Chess is the reason you ever set foot on Phobos in the first place — you played at tournaments all over the solar system and usually placed 
well enough to stave off selling your knee ligaments for scrip. The current board reflects your efforts to teach Joe  how to play. He has arranged his pieces in a frowny face, which, while not 
technically a series of legal chess moves, certainly speaks volumes on life these days, as chess is wont to do.

>t joe
That person is asleep.

Your Office
Your office is on the 6th floor of the tallest building on Phobos. From the roof of this building you can see the bubble and in saner days it was guarded.

This room is dominated by a massive carved rock desk. A sofa is off to the side, next to your mini-fridge and chess table. On the ceiling is your projector.

>wake joe
It’s useless, he’s the most complete and dedicated sleeper you have ever known. 

>x joe
Joe has a big, friendly face, an athlete’s body and an often blank mind that betrays his origin —  he is a second pantomime of a dead baseball player. A copy of a copy.
He is asleep on your couch.

It is not possible to get the game in an unwinnable state. Talking to the characters is critical to advance the action, and Raif usually has a couple options for tone and/or attitude throughout the game.

Your office is on the 6th floor of the tallest building on Phobos. From the roof of this building you can see the bubble and in saner days it was guarded.

This room is dominated by a massive carved rock desk. A sofa is off to the side, next to your mini-fridge and chess table. On the ceiling is your projector.

>speak to phone

>hint
You don’t need to use the word “hint”.

>i
