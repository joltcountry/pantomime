Outside Kangaroo’s Midnight Gentleman’s Club
You are in line, waiting for entry into Kangaroo’s Midnight Gentleman’s Club, the only respectable and accessible media outlet for important political and social announcements like who the new dog catcher is, whether or not you’re going to get that 
pro sports team and when, exactly, Phobos is going to break up into an awfully inhospitable ring around Mars.

Mr Chmod is here.

What next? >x chmod
Artificial intelligence reached a breakthrough years ago when a computer science grad student and extreme programmer named Melvin tried to get his robot to drive in downtown Denver during rush hour. Mendenhall learned that his construct was 
wholly able to blend in from exit 195 to 240 even though his code had several logic errors in the driving routines. The robot noticed as many unblinking turn signals, acts of tailgating and poor decision making during lane merges from the other drivers 
— as well as producing as many extended middle fingers — as Mendenhall’s own driving did. Because you write the tests before the code in extreme programming Mendenhall pronounced his work as complete and graduated. 

The next day Mendenhall’s robot left at half past three and initiated the obligatory evening-commute-turned-parking-lot by crashing into an abandoned Passat in the breakdown lane. Mendenhall pronounced it as the proudest day of his life. 

Mr Chmod is a sentient shop-vac and likewise, extreme programmed. He is two meters in height with long, floppy arms and a variety of attachments on the back. He has tank tread at the bottom of his slender base that provide locomotion and a 
small cynlinder at head level that contains most of his brain procedures and a Toronto Blue Jays cap you gave him. He is gray and red and has a ‘TYPE R’ sticker that was unknowingly placed on his back by you.

You are carrying a red keycard.

[We won’t bother with the ‘What Next?’ bit any longer.]

Venting your frustrations on Mr Chmod won’t accomplish much.

“Little,” says Chmod. “I’ve been here every night for the last two weeks, ever since I cashed out my Roth IRA.”

“Whoa!” you say. “Hey, congratulations. I thought you were going to use that money to get off this moon, though? Why would you want to hang around the sphincter of the solar system for a second longer than you had to?”

“Well, have you seen the new girls they’ve got working here? It changed everything. I can’t leave. Not yet. It’s very frustrating.”

“Because you’re a robot and they are cloned pantomimes of long-dead Earth girls, and how will they ever understand you, coming from such radically different worlds?”

“No. Because I haven’t got a penis.” Always an uncomfortable topic when broached, you stare at the ground for a few moments. It still looks like gray sand. “Besides,” adds Chmod, “this place only allows real girls.”

The doorman arrives from the north.

>x doorman
Not everyone gladhandled their way onto Phobos due to their charm and good looks like you did, Raif. Some denizens look like they were either spontaneously generated from some of the wetter craters, or else pantomimed from some of the bulgier 
parts of Sir John Merrick. The doorman might not have a ticket on a solar flight back to Earth, but maybe if he hangs on tight he can surf a rock down to the surface — it’s only 4600 meters. He’d have experienced farther average distances from 
most females if he didn’t work at Kangaroo’s.

“People, and machines, navigate Mars and its two moons through the use of keycards,” says Chmod. “Why don’t you check to see if you have one for this club?”

Chmod sighs. It comes out all fuzzy. “He is the person who can let you into the club. That is his job. Give him your keycard. He keeps the riff-raff out.”

And it’s true. When man colonized the Moon he sent his best engineers, technicians, pioneers and survivors. When he imprinted upon Mars, Titan and Ganymede he did the same. By the time the life bubble was ready on Phobos mankind was 
really just looking for a place to dump its extra and unwanted pantomimes. An entire world filled to the brim with poor copies of undesirables that nobody particularly cared for the first time around.

With that much human garbage around there was a growing need for people to keep them out of places. This has worked reasonably well. You can’t quite leave a fresh-baked apple pie out on your ledge, but you can put the trash out and expect to 
get your cans back.

>give card to doorman

“Okay,” he says, “You can go in.” He lets Chmod past as well.

“Hey!” cries out some nobody a few places back in line, “How come the robot gets to go in? He ain’t got a card!”

“Shut up,” suggests the doorman. “You could all shut up...  The robot spent more here last night than any of you have in the last month.” That seems to satisfy the crowd for the most part, at least those who care about a walking shop vac getting 
some place before them.

Chmod bristles for a second. “That’s embarrassing, man... don’t tell them that.”

The doorman looks ready to affix a ‘Lap Dance King’ sticker to Chmod.

Purchasing Kiosk
There is no real difference in light level between the surface of Phobos and this tight little payment chamber except that it’s more blue in here. To your left is a wizened old soul behind a bulletproof window. You can buy a ‘membership’ for the night 
from him, but it’s really just a cover charge. A pair of closed, dark blue curtains lurk north, shielding you from the debauchary beyond, in case you created some interference to your moral compass by getting this far without realizing it. You can hear 
some muffled music in that direction and it smells like ham in here.

Mr Chmod is here.

>x soul
This older Asian fellow sits stooped upon a bar stool behind a strong, transparent shield. Chmod has told you that apparently a not-insignificant number of Phobos dwellers get this far into the club and then just snap when faced with the 
‘membership fee’ you have to buy for the evening. One guy brought out a morning star, which you had never heard of outside of one of those long-forgotten kid’s games like ‘Dungeons and Dragons,’  ‘Magic: The Gathering’ or ‘Connect Four.’ The 
guy was tackled before he got a good swing with his weapon, but the old guy sitting before you was sufficiently spooked to demand unbreakable glass to sit behind.

You can’t go that way until you buy a membership for the night.

Purchasing Kiosk
This is a dark, blue-lit little payment chamber. An old guy sits behind a bulletproof glass window, bored with everything. A pair of curtains lie north and there’s an exit outside to the Phobian surface to the south.

Mr Chmod is here.

“Oh, yeah... sorry, I’m a little distracted. You left it at my apartment last night.” Mr. Chmod opens up a small compartment and hands you your wallet. “Just show this to the old guy and we can get inside.”

The old soul doesn’t seem too interested in the wallet.

>pay soul
That’s not for sale.

It’s a nigh-weightless piece of folded-over plastic. It’s got an invisible chip in it that lets vendors do transactions with it wirelessly.

You have 105 Phobian scrip.

Kangaroo’s Midnight Gentleman’s Club
Bars on all sides surround a central stage where a slick, rectangular dancing platform sits. Most adult clubs have either a Marilyn Monroe or Audrey Hepburn clone working for them because people born in the 20th century don’t have their DNA under 
an ironclad copyright. However, the owner of this club prides himself on having no pantomimes dancing. The DJ’s patter is a painful hipster and the girls hardly ever lip synch the words of the songs.

Scarlett waves for you and Chmod to walk over and sit down next to her.

Mr Chmod is here.

There is a lone stool available for you to sit on. Luckily, it’s next to Scarlett.

>x scarlett
Scarlett is wearing a white, long-sleeved blouse, a billowy gypsy’s skirt and a zebra-print headband. 

A gorgeous redhead gracefully struts up to the center stage wearing only stiletto heels and a microphone on a ring. She clears her voice and gives the crowd a confident smile. She’s one of the best-looking women ever to leave Earth and has no 
problem commanding the attention of the room.

>t scarlett

[1] “Hi, there!”
[2] “Thank you for saving us seats!”

Select an option or 0 to say nothing >> 1

“WHAT?” says Scarlett. She gestures to the overpowering music playing.

The redhead self-conciously coughs once into her microphone. “I’m Cinnamon,” she purrs. The crowd applauds and hoots. She smiles with such warmth that Mimas evaporates. “I’d like to thank you all for coming tonight. We have a very special 
guest at the club tonight... you know him as the Governor of New York and for the campaign he’s running to be President of the United States of America... Ladies and Gentlemen — “ she laughs and brings the mic away from her face for a moment. 
This woman has a three-picture deal back on Earth and was leaving the moon soon anyway. “I present William Howard Taft!”

There is applause everywhere, managing to drown out the horrible music that the DJ has faithfully not stopped playing. It’s all very enthusiastic, save for the very, very back of the club near the curtains.

>t scarlett

[1] “Thank you for saving us seats!”
[2] “HI THERE!”

“WHAT? SAY AGAIN?” says Scarlett. The background music seems to squeeze all other audio right out of the room.

Taft walks briskly up to the stage, all business. Cinnamon slowly peels off the microphone from her ring finger and passes it to Taft, bending down slightly to give him a kiss on the cheek. Taft takes the opportunity to squeeze a breast, to the banal, 
delighted fury of the crowd. You see Scarlett wipe her brow; it’s really starting to get warm in here. Taft laughs in that sort of chortle that big guys make and puts the mic on.

“Thank you all for being here tonight. Thank you all...” Taft wrinkles his nose for a second as he notices the commotion going on at the back of the club.

>t scarlett

[1] “HI THERE!”
[2] “THANKS FOR SAVING US SEATS!”

Select an option or 0 to say nothing >> 1

“OH! HI THERE YOURSELF, BUSTER!” Scarlett isn’t deaf or anything, it’s just very noisy inside the club. “WHAT CHANNEL ARE YOU ON?” she shouts.

“4D4.. 94D... 65!” you shout back. It takes forever, but it’s the usual one you use so she figures it out when you’re halfway through. She sets a register on the chip implanted deep within her spine to the same channel as you and conversation 
becomes quite possible without shouting. It’s not telepathy or anything, but doing so allows you to talk each other while the DJ plays the current diva’s latest tune (in her never-ending and well-precedented career track that oscillates between virgin 
and whore, she is firmly within the screeching whore track this month).

Taft begins his speech even though it’s clear he’d like the room to be free of distractions. Even though it concerns a moon nobody on Earth cares about, the fate of Phobos is still pretty critical to everyone on it. After a few honeyed words to begin his 
opening, however, he finds the ruckus towards the back intolerable.

“Excuse me,” he says, away from the microphone and to one of the club’s nearby bouncers. It appears as if Taft wants them to do something about the shouting coming from the back of the club. You turn to say something snotty about Taft to 
Scarlett when you hear two pops — two sharp shots about two seconds apart. You see Taft collapse to the floor. Things quickly turn to bedlam inside the club.

>t cinnamon
You can’t think of anything to say right now.

>t chmod
You can’t think of anything to say right now.

>t scarlett
Scarlett isn’t able to speak to anyone right now.

>x taft
Taft today is not as large as he was when he was President of the United States of America, but he’s still pretty roomy. He has Criscoed brown hair, a handlebar moustache that hasn’t been in style in almost 200 years and locomotes with a 
waddling gait.

He  is dead.

Chmod, facing a different direction than you, suddenly gasps. “Oh... oh, no...” 

He presses one of his cold robotic hands against your shoulder and turns you around. You see Scarlett sitting upright, so comfortably in her chair... her dead eyes looking straight ahead, head slumped to the side, her white blouse quickly turning a 
deep crimson.



Long ago, far away


Night life on Phobos consisted of throwing rocks at pantomimes of long-dead politicians and celebrities who were unpopular in their original lives.

It was long before you had ever heard of Taft or shrinking orbits or localized planetary rings. It was a Saturday. You and Scarlett heard screams a few hundred meters before you even got to the gate. The crowd was really giving the new guy a 
workout. It was theraputic for the populace — nobody who made it to Phobos wanted to stay there for more a few days, but shuttles only ran once every two (Earth) months. The time died slow and hard, and punching a Mugabe kept everyone sane.

There were a few rules hastily scrawled onto a tablet that you had to read before you could fork over the admission fee. You could not ask direct questions to the entertainment. You could not feed the entertainment. You had to stay ten meters away 
from the entertainment and could only throw rocks, as tomatoes were a premium on Phobos.  Mugabe wouldn’t shut up and stop bleating so you could read the rest of the rules in peace. 

Mugabe kept proclaiming that he had no idea why he was chained up, why he was there, why he was being tortured, who he was... You asked the clerk about it and he just gave a bored shrug and said that they get that a lot. Everyone is innocent. 
Nobody harmed a soul in their original lifetime - just ask them. A mime’s memories were intact from the day they died and there was usually a lot of begging for forgiveness and apologizing. That wasn’t the case with the new guy. This one’s head 
was empty. (Technically, his head was a bruised and lumpy mess due to all the pulverized moon rock that was thrown at it, but his mind was a blank, anyway.) 

Your face screwed up as you entered into a deep thought. You turned to face Scarlett. “There’s something we haven’t completely thought out here,” you said. “Something isn’t quite right about how we’re going to do this. Something nobody 
considered...” Scarlett’s head cocked to the side as to just what was the matter.

“What is it, love?” she said.

“Where on Phobos are we going to find any rocks?”
